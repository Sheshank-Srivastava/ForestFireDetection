# ForestFireDetection
Forest fires are a menace to the environment and disturb the ecological balance in the environment. There is a need to detect forest fire in early stages, so as to take appropriate preventive measures. Wireless Sensor Networks have proved to be useful for the early detection of Forest fires. There are many methods proposed for early detection of forest fires, from which monitoring the environmental conditions and gasses have proven to be most useful. In this paper, we discuss the early developments of one such wireless sensor network systems for early and efficient detection of forest fire.
